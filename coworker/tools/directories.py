"""The `request_directory` tool — the agent asks the user to grant access to a folder.

Unlike ordinary tools, this one is intercepted by the TurnEngine: it emits a DIRECTORY_REQUESTED
event and waits for the user to pick/approve a folder out-of-band (the GUI surfaces a prompt),
then the live session gains that root and the tool result tells the agent the outcome. The
callable here is only a schema carrier + a safe fallback for surfaces without a requester.
