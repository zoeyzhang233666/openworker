"""Address guard for URLs the model chooses.

`web_fetch` and `browser_read_url` take a URL straight from the model, and the model's
input is untrusted by design — it reads web pages, email and Slack messages, all of which
are documented as "data, not instructions". A page that talks the agent into fetching
`http://169.254.169.254/` or `http://127.0.0.1:11434/` turns a read-only research tool into
a probe of the machine's own network position, and `web_fetch` is `requires_approval=False`,
so no prompt ever appears.

This blocks the ranges that are only reachable *because* OpenWorker runs on the user's
machine: loopback, RFC1918 and other private space, link-local (which covers the cloud
metadata endpoint at 169.254.169.254), and the reserved/multicast blocks.

Every hop is checked, not just the first: `follow_redirects=True` otherwise lets a public
URL 302 straight to loopback, which is the standard way this filter is bypassed.

DNS rebinding is closed by connection-level pinning: `get_checked` rewrites each hop so the
client connects to the exact address that passed the check (name in Host and SNI, so virtual
hosting and certificate verification still see the name). A record with a ~0 TTL that flips
to 127.0.0.1 between the check and the connect therefore changes nothing — the client never
resolves the name itself. `check_url` alone (browser_open_url's pre-check) still carries the
resolve-twice gap, because the browser owns its own connections and cannot be pinned from here.
