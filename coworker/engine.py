"""TurnEngine — the owned agent loop.

Async, but with blocking provider/tool calls wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` so the loop
(and any UI consuming its events) stays responsive. One user turn spans many model↔tool
iterations until the model stops requesting tools, a rail trips, or it's interrupted.
When the model requests several tool calls in one turn, low-risk ones (reads, searches)
execute concurrently; writes/shell stay strictly ordered.

Approvals are handled out-of-band via an injected async `approver`: when the permission
engine says `needs_user`, the engine emits `PERMISSION_REQUIRED` and awaits the approver.
