"""PyInstaller spec for the bundled `openworker-server` (desktop sidecar).

One-DIR bundle (exe + `_internal/` support folder) shipped via Tauri's `resources` slot.
It used to be a onefile binary in the externalBin slot, but onefile self-extracts its whole
archive to a temp dir on EVERY launch — 6-7s of "Starting coworker…" splash (measured; the
actual Python import is ~0.5s). The wrinkles handled here:
  - aisuite is a regular pip dependency (git-pinned in pyproject.toml); collect coworker +
    aisuite submodules from the venv.
  - uvicorn loads its protocol/lifespan impls dynamically → collect_all.
  - certifi's CA bundle must ship for TLS (OpenAI, web search, Telegram/Slack).
  - messaging extras (slack_bolt, telegram, wecom_aibot_sdk) are optional; collected if importable.

Cross-platform: paths are derived from this spec's own location (SPECPATH), never hardcoded,
so the same spec builds native binaries on macOS, Windows, and Linux. On Windows PyInstaller
appends `.exe` to `name`. The binary is built as a normal console app on every OS — a windowed
(console=False) build leaves sys.stdout/stderr as None, which breaks uvicorn's startup logging
and hangs the server. To avoid a console window flashing in the desktop app, the Tauri shell
spawns this sidecar with the Windows CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag (see src-tauri/src/lib.rs), which
hides the window while keeping stdio intact.
